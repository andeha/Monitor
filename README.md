# A MIPS/PIC32 Monitor Program

**This program helps you** upload your programs, interact with your chip, insert hardware breakpoints and see how control flows when your program is run.

[**monitor_PIC32MX470F512L.hex**][ref] Enables the chips' UART5 where port RF13 (pin 39) is U5TX, and port RF12 (pin 40) is U5RX. This binary can upload programs up to 2 kB of size.
